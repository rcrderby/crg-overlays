## Overview

It's common for streamers to display a penalty overlay data during timeouts, although it isn't always easy for viewers to understand what that data means.  That's especially true when a penalty overlay might only be visible for a few seconds.  The intent of this overlay is to provide a simple view of penalty and game status information in a format that makes it easy to see:

- Which teams are playing each other.
- The score, period, and game clock.
- Which team is on which side of the screen.
- Which players have penalties, and how many they have.
- Which players have high penalty counts, fouled out, or been expelled.
- How many penalties each team has.
- Basic tournament information, if applicable.
- Optionally, the host league or sanctioning body's logo.
